`Xitrum <http://ngocdaothanh.github.com/xitrum>`_
is an async and clustered Scala web framework
and HTTP(S) server on top of `Netty <http://netty.io/>`_
and `Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_.
From `a user <https://groups.google.com/group/xitrum-framework/msg/d6de4865a8576d39>`_:

  Wow, this is a really impressive body of work, arguably the most
  complete Scala framework outside of Lift (but much easier to use).

  `Xitrum <http://ngocdaothanh.github.com/xitrum>`_ is truly a full stack web framework, all the bases are covered,
  including wtf-am-I-on-the-moon extras like ETags, static file cache
  identifiers & auto-gzip compression. Tack on built-in JSON converter,
  before/around/after interceptors, request/session/cookie/flash scopes,
  integrated validation (server & client-side, nice), built-in cache
  layer (`Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_), i18n a la GNU gettext, Netty (with Nginx, hello
  blazing fast), etc. and you have, wow.

Features:

* Fast built-in HTTP and HTTPS web server based on `Netty <http://netty.io/>`_.
* Extensive caching for faster responding.
  At the web server layer, small files are cached in memory, big files are sent
  using NIO's zero copy. Xitrum's static file serving speed is
  `similar to that of Nginx <https://gist.github.com/3293596>`_.
  At the web framework layer you have can declare page, action, and object cache
  in the Rails style.
  `All Google's best practices <http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rules_intro.html>`_
  like conditional GET are applied.
* The framework tries to fill the spectrum between `Scalatra <https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra>`_
  and `Lift <http://liftweb.net/>`_: more powerful than Scalatra and easier to
  use than Lift. You can easily create both RESTful APIs and postbacks. `Xitrum <http://ngocdaothanh.github.com/xitrum>`_
  is controller-first like Scalatra, not
  `view-first <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/View_First>`_ like Lift.
  Most people are familliar with controller-first style.
* Routes are automatically collected in the spirit of JAX-RS (but without annotations!)
  and Rails Engines. You don't have to declare all routes in a single place.
  Think of this feature as distributed routes. You can plug an app into another app.
  If you have a blog engine, you can package it as a JAR file, then you can put
  that JAR file into another app and that app automatically has blog feature!
  Routing is also two-way: you can recreate URLs (reverse routing) in a typesafe way.
* Typesafe, in the spirit of Scala. All the APIs try to be as typesafe as possible.
* Async, in the spirit of Netty. Your request proccessing action does not have
  to respond immediately. Long polling, chunked response (streaming), and WebSocket
  are supported.
* Views can be written in a separate `Scalate <http://scalate.fusesource.org/>`_
  template file or Scala inline XML. Both are typesafe.
* Sessions can be stored in cookies (more scalable) or clustered `Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_ (more secure).
  `Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_ is recommended when using continuations-based Actions, since serialized
  continuations are usually too big to store in cookies.
* `jQuery Validation <http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation>`_ is integrated
  for browser side and server side validation.
* i18n using `GNU gettext <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_gettext>`_.
  Translation text extraction is done automatically.
  You don't have to manually mess with properties files.
  You can use powerful tools like `Poedit <http://www.poedit.net/screenshots.php>`_
  for translating and merging translations.
  gettext is unlike most other solutions, both singular and plural forms are supported.

`Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_ also gives:

* In-process and distribued cache, you don't need separate cache servers.
* In-process and distribued `Comet (with WebSocket) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)>`_,
  you can scale Comet to multiple web servers.

`Xitrum <http://ngocdaothanh.github.com/xitrum>`_ is `open source <https://github.com/ngocdaothanh/xitrum>`_, please join

Create new empty Xitrum project
-------------------------------

To create a new empty project, download
`xitrum-new.zip <http://cloud.github.com/downloads/ngocdaothanh/xitrum-new/xitrum-new.zip>`_:

::

  wget http://cloud.github.com/downloads/ngocdaothanh/xitrum-new/xitrum-new.zip
  unzip xitrum-new.zip
  cd xitrum-new
  sbt/sbt run

Now you have a new empty project running at http://localhost:8000/
and https://localhost:4430/
